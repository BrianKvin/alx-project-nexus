# Job Board Backend ‚Äì ProDev Backend Engineering

This project is part of **Project Nexus**, the capstone of the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program.

## Developing a Backend for a Job Board Platform

This project prepares developers to build **robust backend systems** for platforms requiring complex role management and efficient data retrieval. It focuses on:

- Implementing **role-based access control** and secure authentication
- Designing **efficient database schemas**
- Optimizing **query performance** for large datasets

---

## Overview

This case study centers around building a backend for a **Job Board Platform**. The system supports job postings, user roles (admin/applicant), and optimized search functionality. It emphasizes API design, access control, and backend performance tuning.

---

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this backend project are:

### API Development
- Build RESTful APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.

### Access Control
- Implement role-based authentication using JWT for admins and users.

### Database Efficiency
- Optimize job search features through indexing and query optimization.

---

## Technologies Used

| Technology     | Purpose                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Django         | High-level Python framework for backend APIs |
| PostgreSQL     | Relational database for job data             |
| JWT            | Secure authentication and role enforcement   |
| Swagger (drf-yasg) | API documentation for frontend integration |

---

## Key Features

### Job Posting Management
- CRUD APIs for job listings
- Categorization by industry, location, and type

### Role-Based Authentication
- **Admins** can manage jobs, categories, and view applications
- **Users** can apply for jobs and manage their applications

### üîç Optimized Job Search
- Filter jobs by location, category, job type, and keywords
- Indexed fields for fast and responsive query performance

### API Documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Hosted at `/api/docs/` for easy frontend integration

## Implementation Workflow (Git Commits)

### Initial Setup

```bash
feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
```

### Feature Development

```bash
feat: implement job posting and filtering APIs
feat: add role-based authentication for admins and users
```

### Optimization

```bash
perf: optimize job search queries with indexing
```

### Documentation

```bash
feat: integrate Swagger for API documentation
docs: update README with usage details
```

---

## Submission & Deployment

* Deploy the Django backend and Swagger UI (locally or via a cloud provider)
* Ensure all endpoints are accessible and documented

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Functionality

* Job and category APIs support full CRUD operations
* Role-based authentication works correctly

### Code Quality

* Modular, clean, and adheres to Django best practices
* Normalized and efficient database schema

### Performance

* Job search APIs are fast and responsive
* Indexing and query optimization in place

### Documentation

* Swagger docs fully describe the API
* README provides clear and complete setup instructions

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Hands-on experience with role-based access control
* Built scalable, production-like API endpoints
* Gained deeper understanding of optimizing databases for search-heavy applications
