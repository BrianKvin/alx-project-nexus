# Project Nexus - Backend Engineering

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my **Project Nexus** — the capstone project for the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program. This is where I’ve put everything I’ve learned about backend development into practice. My goal with this project is to build a functional and scalable backend system that showcases the skills I've acquired, including API design, database optimization, security practices, and performance enhancements.

In this README, I’ll walk you through the key objectives, technologies, and real-world applications I’ve been working on, as well as how I approached each project.

## Project Overview

Project Nexus is the final phase of the ProDev Backend Engineering program, where we apply everything we've learned in real-world scenarios. It's an opportunity to dive deep into backend technologies, design scalable systems, and address common challenges developers face. Throughout the project, I've been working on several different backend systems that cover a wide array of real-world use cases, from e-commerce to social media platforms.

### Project Goals

* **Real-World Applications**: Build systems that mimic real-world use cases, focusing on scalability, security, and performance.
* **Backend Mastery**: Create APIs, design databases, and optimize systems to handle large amounts of data and traffic.
* **Problem-Solving**: Overcome challenges like database optimization, asynchronous processing, and caching to deliver high-performance backends.
* **Collaboration**: Work with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration.

## Technologies

I've been using a variety of modern backend technologies throughout the project. Here are some of the key tools I’ve worked with:

* **Django**: A Python framework that has been incredibly useful for quickly building robust and scalable backends.
* **Django REST Framework**: To build RESTful APIs that are easy to maintain and integrate with other services.
* **PostgreSQL**: My go-to relational database, which I’ve used for building efficient data models and optimizing queries.
* **GraphQL**: For flexible and efficient querying in some of my projects.
* **Redis**: Used for caching to speed up responses and reduce load on the database.
* **Celery & RabbitMQ**: To handle background tasks like sending notifications and processing data asynchronously.
* **Docker**: For containerizing my applications, making them easy to deploy and scale.
* **JWT**: To manage secure user authentication.
* **CI/CD**: Automating testing and deployment with GitHub Actions to streamline the development process.

## Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated on several aspects, but here’s how I’m planning to focus on the most important ones:

### Functionality & Features

* I’ve made sure to implement all core features required by each project, and I’ve tried to go above and beyond by adding extra functionality like background tasks, pagination, and advanced querying.

### Code Quality & Best Practices

* I aim for clean, modular, and maintainable code. Version control is a key part of my process, with frequent commits to keep everything organized.

### Database Design & Efficiency

* I’ve put a lot of effort into designing efficient database schemas, normalizing tables, and optimizing queries to ensure everything runs smoothly, even under heavy loads.

### Security & Performance

* Using JWT for secure authentication, and focusing on optimizing performance through caching and query indexing.

### Documentation & Presentation

* A major goal for me was making sure the code is well-documented and that the project is easy for others to understand. I’ve written clear API docs and included a comprehensive `README.md`.

### Innovation & Problem Solving

* I’ve tried to add some creative solutions where applicable — like integrating third-party APIs for movie recommendations or implementing GraphQL for flexible querying in a social media feed.

## Collaboration & Resources

Collaboration was essential throughout the process, especially when working on projects that involved frontend development. I’ve also made use of a ton of resources to help me succeed:

* **Django Documentation**: For everything Django-related.
* **PostgreSQL Documentation**: Understanding database design and optimization.
* **Docker Documentation**: To containerize and scale my projects.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For documenting and testing my APIs.
* **Postman**: Used for API testing.
* **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
* **Google Meet/Zoom**: For virtual meetings and team discussions.
* **Trello/Notion**: To track progress and manage milestones.

---

## Project Submission

For each project, I’ve been required to submit:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Where I’ve stored the source code, configuration files, and any other important project details.
2. **Presentation Slides**: A short but concise presentation of the project architecture, the challenges I faced, and the final product.
3. **Video Demo**: A walkthrough of the functionality in action to show that it all works as intended.

---

## Timeline

* **Start Date**: July 21, 2025
* **Submission Deadline**: August 10, 2025
* **Project Review Period**: August 11 – 18, 2025

## Conclusion

Project Nexus is a huge milestone in my backend engineering journey. It’s where I got to apply everything I’ve learned in real-world scenarios, tackle complex problems, and build full-fledged backend systems. Each project helped me deepen my understanding of backend development and gave me the tools I need to build scalable, efficient, and secure systems.

I’m excited to see how all my hard work comes together and to share the results with the world!
