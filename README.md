## Project Overview

Project Nexus focuses on designing and implementing robust backend systems. Learners will work on creating various backend applications, ranging from e-commerce platforms to social media feeds, using industry-standard tools and methodologies. The project emphasizes core backend engineering concepts such as database design, API development, and performance optimization.

### Objectives

* **Real-World Application**: Apply learned skills to solve real-world problems.
* **Scalable & Efficient Design**: Design and build scalable backend systems using modern technologies.
* **Database Design**: Design relational databases with optimized schemas and queries.
* **API Design**: Develop robust RESTful or GraphQL APIs with proper documentation.
* **Security & Performance**: Implement security best practices and optimize the system for high performance.
* **Collaboration**: Collaborate with frontend engineers to ensure seamless integration.

## Technologies

Project Nexus offers flexibility in technology choices, allowing learners to build their project using a variety of modern tools and frameworks.

### Backend Technologies:

* **Django**: For rapid backend development with scalability in mind.
* **Django REST Framework**: For building RESTful APIs.
* **GraphQL**: For advanced, flexible API querying.
* **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for efficient data storage.
* **Celery & RabbitMQ**: For managing asynchronous tasks and background jobs.
* **Redis**: Caching system for improving performance.
* **Docker**: For containerizing applications for easy deployment.
* **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
* **CI/CD**: Automate testing and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions.

## Evaluation Criteria

Mentors will review the project based on the following categories:

### Functionality & Features

* All core features implemented as required.
* Additional features such as real-time updates, background tasks, and advanced API features (e.g., GraphQL) will be given extra consideration.

### Code Quality & Best Practices

* Code should be clean, modular, and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.
* Proper use of version control (GitHub), including clear and frequent commits.

### Database Design & Efficiency

* Schema design should be efficient, normalized, and optimized for fast queries.
* Advanced database features like indexing, relationships, and joins will be evaluated.

### Security & Performance

* Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT).
* Optimized performance (caching, query optimization, etc.).

### Documentation & Presentation

* A well-documented project, including a detailed `README.md`, API documentation, and instructions for deployment.
* Clear and confident project presentation during the review.

### Innovation & Problem Solving

* Projects that show advanced problem-solving, creative solutions, and real-world applicability will be highly valued.
